1. What is the difference between readyState and status in XMLHttpRequest?

readyState tells you what stage the request is currently in. As the browser communicates with the server, it moves through several steps:

0 – UNSENT: The request hasn’t started yet.

1 – OPENED: The request has been created and is ready to go.

2 – HEADERS_RECEIVED: The server has responded and the headers are available.

3 – LOADING: The browser is in the middle of receiving data.

4 – DONE: Everything is complete and the full response is ready.

status, on the other hand, is the server’s HTTP response code, which tells you how the request turned out.
For example:

200 means everything went well,

404 means the file wasn’t found,

500 means the server had an error.

So, in simple terms:
readyState shows the progress, while status shows the final result.

2. How can you make the request asynchronous?

You make the request asynchronous by setting the third argument of xhr.open() to true, like this:

xhr.open("GET", "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1", true);


This allows your page to keep working—running scripts, responding to clicks, and updating the interface—while the request is happening in the background.

3. Why is asynchronous communication recommended for web applications?

Asynchronous communication keeps your website from freezing while it waits for the server to respond. This means:

The user can still interact with the page.

Other parts of the site continue running normally.

Content can load quietly in the background without interrupting anything.

Overall, it makes the website feel smoother, faster, and much more pleasant to use.
